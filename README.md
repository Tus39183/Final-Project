# spotifyapi 
This is a simple discord bot that uses the spotipy library to access the spotify web api and run five simple commands. \
/create_playlist:'artist' will essentially generate a playlist of 10 random songs from any given artist on the spotify website.\
/new_releases:'country' will find new album releases in a specific country and list them along with a link. \
/search_artist:'artist' will create a simple overview of a specific artist along with a link to view their spotify profile.\
/top_songs:'artist' will find and list 10 of the most popular songs from a specific artist.\
/trending:'genre' will find 5 trending artist from a specific artist and provide you with a link to view their spotify profile.

To create the bot we had to learn how discord bots are setup and we used a simple template found at https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/blob/main/cogs/fun.py. Initially we wanted to include more features like using the bot to find similar artist/songs based on a user's listening history but we were ultimately time strapped near the end. Besides learning about classes and objects and other python specific areas, we also had to learn how to setup an .env file, how to push and commit changes to github and how a git repository worked.
